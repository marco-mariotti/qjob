Welcome to qjob's documentation!
================================

Qjob simplifies the everyday tasks of users of a computing cluster.
It allows to conveniently turn a set of commands into *jobs*
which are submitted for execution to a queue.
Two queueing systems are currently supported by qjob:

  - The Sun Oracle Engine (SGE, also known as Oracle Grid Engine)
  - The Slurm Workload Manager (Slurm)
    

To install qjob, check the :doc:`installation` page.

Next, follow the :doc:`tutorial` to familiarize yourself with its usage.

For any problem, check the :doc:`troubleshooting` page.
